# Photographic Mosaic Creation

## Overview
This project explores the blend of computational photography and computer vision through the creation of photographic mosaics. The objective is to reconstruct a target image using smaller image tiles, ensuring both artistic appeal and computational efficiency. Core techniques like **color matching**, **adaptive tiling**, and **blending** are utilized to craft visually stunning mosaics. 

## üî¨ Implementation Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing 
- **Tile Data Preparation**:
  - Extracts average color features from tile images.
  - Saves preprocessed data into a CSV for quick access.
- **Target Image Preparation**:
  - Segments the target image into grids, ensuring compatibility with tile data.

### 2. Mosaic Generation 
- **Grid Division**:
  - Divides the target image into cells (e.g., 10x10 grid for `Lion_10x10`).
  - Computes average colors for each grid cell as the foundation for tile matching.
- **Tile Matching and Diversity**:
  - Finds the closest matching tiles based on advanced vectorized calculations.
  - Enforces diversity rules to minimize repetition and enhance visual interest.
- **Adaptive Tiling**:
  - Adjusts tile sizes dynamically based on the image's detail map, balancing fine detail and efficiency.
- **Advanced Blending**:
  - Integrates tiles seamlessly using alpha and Poisson blending for realistic effects.

### 3. Output Variations
- **Grid Configurations**: Supports grids like 10x10, 20x20, 25x25, and 50x50.
- **Adaptive Mosaics**: Leverages edge detection for detail-aware tiling.
